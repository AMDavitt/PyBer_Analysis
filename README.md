# PyBer_Analysis 
# Overview of ride sharing analysis:
* The purpose of this challenge was to analyze the weekly fares over a five month period of the three different markets that the PyBer ride sharing operates in (Rural, Suburban, Urban). Additional metrics reviewed included total rides, total drivers, total revenue, and the averages for each.
# Results
* Viewing the data grid for the first part of the challenge, we can see that that rural areas have fewer rides, drivers, and revenue resulting in a higher overall ride average cost and fare per drive. Oppositely, the higher volume of participants in the urban market results in cheaper average rides and smaller fares per drive.

* When viewing the data overtime on the line graph, certain flucations can be viewed for certain months within region, however, the data clearly shows large differences in revenue across urban, suburban, and rural regions across the five month period.

# Summary for CEO
* Rural business could improve by offering a discount to first time riders, by increasing the rider pool it would bring down average ride cost and bolster user adoption
* Suburban users saw some of the most price fluctuations over time (especially between February and March) by offering drivers a bonus of some sort during fare price spikes to increase the total driver pool for urban users, this would limit price shocks to consumers and guarantee a more flat right which would likey drive further adoption and satisfaction
* The average fare price steadily (with a few dips and spikes) increased for customers over the five month period for urban users, PyBer might want to introduce fare limits in order to retain urban users that might become discouraged by continual price hikes
